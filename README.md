# Real-time clock project
An embedded systems project integrating a NUCLEO-F401RE development board with an Arduino Multifunction Shield to create a dual-function system. It features a Real-Time Clock (RTC) displaying elapsed time in MM\:SS format on a 7-segment display, and an analog voltage display showing potentiometer readings when a button is pressed. The system supports user interaction via dedicated buttons for resetting the clock and switching modes, and seamlessly combines digital I/O components with analog input for efficient hardware integration.
